### 🧠 About Me  
I’m a public health researcher focused on **infectious disease epidemiology**, particularly **HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and hepatitis**.  
My work applies **statistical modeling, data analysis, and reproducible research** to generate insights that inform health policy and practice.  

I have independently conducted large-scale analyses using WHO datasets, applying advanced modeling in R to uncover trends in infectious disease epidemiology.
